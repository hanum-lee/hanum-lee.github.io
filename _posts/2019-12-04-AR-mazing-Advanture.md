# Introduction
We are creating an iOS application. As a team, we decided to make a game. After looking into ARkit, we decided that it will be very interesting to make an Augmented Reality game.
## Objectives

## Challenges
* It was first time learning Swift.
* Since ARkit and SceneKit only works on iPad or iPhones, testing was hard.
* Building the application to the devices took long.
# Conclusion
This project could not have completed if amazing teammates were not there.
